description: '

  The electron mobility is difficult to model purely from first principles.

  This is a semi-empirical model to approximate the electron mobility based on the
  bulk modulus and the electron

  effective mass - two quantities that are readily accessible from first-principles
  calculations.

  The accuracy for band conductors is typically within half an order of magnitude.'
