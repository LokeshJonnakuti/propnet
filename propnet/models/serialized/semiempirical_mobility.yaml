  The electron mobility is difficult to model purely from first principles.
  This is a semi-empirical model to approximate the electron mobility based on the bulk modulus and the electron
  effective mass - two quantities that are readily accessible from first-principles calculations.
  The accuracy for band conductors is typically within half an order of magnitude.
