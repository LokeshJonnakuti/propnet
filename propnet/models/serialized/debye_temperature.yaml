description: "\nAssuming a linear dispersion relationship between angular frequency
  and\nwave number along with a free particle k-vector density of states, the\nDebye
  model is a highly-effective estimate of low-temperature heat capacity.\n\nUsing
  the grand canonical ensemble, the model correctly predicts the transition\nfrom
  increasing heat capacity at low temperatures to roughly constant heat\ncapacity
  at high temperatures (Dulong P\xE9tit rule). This transition occurs\nroughly at
  the Debye temperature.\n\nThe Debye temperature can be shown to depend only on fundamental
  constants,\ndensity of the material, and the effective sound velocity in the material.\nThe
  effective sound velocity is in turn related to the material's bulk modulus.\n\nAt
  intermediate temperatures, especially those around the debye temperature,\ndeviations
  in heat capacity may occur due to a breakdown in the linearity\nof the dispersion
  relationship for real materials.\n"
