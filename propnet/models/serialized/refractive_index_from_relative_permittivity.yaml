description: |
  The refractive index gives the factor by which the speed of light is reduced in a medium.

  Likewise, modeling the induced magnetic and electric dipoles as linear within a material,
  a relative spatial electrical permittivity and relative spatial magnetic permeability
  arise from consideration of the total electrical and magnetic fields.

  From the Maxwell Relations, the index of refraction is equal to the geometric mean  of the
  relative permittivity and the relative permeability.
