description: '


  Proposed as an empirical model relating a material''s band gap to its refractive
  index,

  the Ravindra relation has been shown to be an approximation of the Penn model, with

  co-efficients found by Gupta and Ravindra. See references for more information.
  This

  replaces the older Moss relation, which is also defined.'
