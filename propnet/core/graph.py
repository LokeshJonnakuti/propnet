class Graph(object):
    """
    Class containing methods for creating and interacting with a
    Property Network.

    The Property Network contains a set of Node namedtuples with
    connections stored as directed edges between the nodes.

    Upon initialization a base graph is constructed consisting of all
    valid SymbolTypes and Models found in surrounding folders. These are
    Symbol and Model node_types respectively. Connections are formed
    between the nodes based on given inputs and outputs of the models.
    At this stage the graph represents a symbolic web of properties
    without any actual input values.

    Materials and Properties / Conditions can be added at runtime using
    appropriate support methods. These methods dynamically create
    additional PropnetNodes and edges on the graph of Material and
    Quantity node_types respectively.

    Given a set of Materials and Properties / Conditions, the symbolic
    web of properties can be utilized to predict values of connected
    properties on demand.

    Attributes:
        _symbol_types ({str: Symbol}): data structure mapping Symbol
            name to Symbol object.
        _models ({str: Symbol}): data structure mapping Model name to
            Model object.
        _materials ({Material}): data structure storing the set of all
            materials present on the graph.
        _input_to_model ({Symbol: {Model}}): data structure mapping
            Symbol inputs to a set of corresponding Model objects that
            input that Symbol.
        _output_to_model ({Symbol: {Model}}): data structure mapping
            Symbol outputs to a set of corresponding Model objects that
            output that Symbol.
        _symbol_to_quantity ({Symbol: {Quantity}}): data structure
