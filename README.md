# Propnet

Propnet is a knowledge graph for materials science. Given a set of *properties* about a given material, it can try to derive additional properties of that material using *models*. It is intended to integrated closely with the [Materials Project](http://materialsproject.org) and its large database of materials properties.

Propnet can also be used as a library, each model can be imported and used directly in your own code, giving you tested, unit-aware implementations of common materials science models.

# Installation and Use

Currently, a lot of ideas are still in flux, and there are no guarantees anything works!

The recommended way to install and use the package is to use `pipenv`. Clone the package locally and run `pipenv install --dev`, followed by `pipenv shell` to launch Propnet inside a virtual environment.

If you want to use the Materials Project interface, please set your `PMG_MAPI_KEY` environment variable appropriately (or add it to a .env file inside the Propnet directory to have it be used automatically during installation).

To run Propnet inside a Jupyter notebook, run:

```bash
pipenv install ipykernel
pipenv shell
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=propnet-dev
jupyter notebook
```

A `propnet-dev` kernel will then be available inside Jupyter.


# Guidelines for Contributions

Each symbol and model lives in its own distinct file, with its filename matching the canonical name of the symbol or model. Adding a symbol or model will mean copy one of the existing examples and changing as appropriate, then submitting a pull request. It's also possible to add a symbol or model dynamically for advanced usage.

## Submitting a Symbol

All symbols can be found in `/symbols/`. These are split into `properties`, for material properties (these are typically scalars, vectors or tensors, and have physical units associated with them), `conditions` (essentially free variables, such as temperature, or applied stress) and `objects` (a catch-all for any other Python objects such as a pymatgen crystallographic structure or formula string).

Symbols are defined in [YAML](http://yaml.org) syntax, with key fields are as follows:

* `name`: A unique, canonical name for the property, lowercase, must be a valid Python identifier (no spaces)
* `category`: `property`, `condition` or `object`
* `display_names`: List of human-readable name(s), LaTeX syntax allowed, first name will be the preferred name
* `display_symbols`: As above, but for symbols
* `unit`: (only for `property`, or `condition`) A list of of lists, from [pint's serialization format](http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/serialization.html)
* `shape`: (only for `property`, or `condition`) The expected shape (using the same definition as [numpy ndarray shape](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.shape.html)) of the property. If there are multiple ways to define the property (e.g. vector, scalar), define multiple properties with a simple model to convert between them.
* `comment`: Optional string with additional information.

If you want to check your unit definitions, the easiest way is to try it interactively:

```
from pint import UnitRegistry
ureg = UnitRegistry()
# replace "..." with your units here
my_units = ureg.parse_expression("...")
# check units look correct
print(my_units)
# and convert to tuple
my_units = my_units.to_tuple()
```

## Submitting a Model

All models can be found in `/models/`.

Please copy an existing model and submit a pull request. There are typically two files associated with a model: a .py file containing the class (a subclass of `AbstractModel`) and any relevant logic (if applicable), and a .yaml file containing metadata (title, description, inputs/outputs, and the like) that is automatically loaded into the class provided its filename matches the model class name.

If a model is a simple analytical equation, an equation can be specified in the .yaml file and this will be solved automatically by the base class, otherwise you will have to implement custom logic to evaluate your model.

The model metadata is as follows:

* `title`, `tags`, `description` and `references` for documenting the model, `tags` is a list of strings of whatever seems like a sensible tag for the model (for example 'mechanical', 'thermo' or 'electronic'), 'stub' is a special tag for trivial models that simply convert one representation of a property to a different equivalent representation, for example due to different notations etc., `references` should be a list of strings in BibTeX format
* `symbol_mapping`: for convenience, your model should use short `symbols` to represent quantities, e.g. `E` for `youngs_modulus`, the symbol mapping gives the canonical property name for each symbol
* `connections` gives the valid inputs and outputs for the model
* `evaluate` takes a dictionary of symbols and their associated values for inputs, and a desired `output_symbol`, and will return the value for the output symbol if possible, or `None` if it cannot be solved for that output symbol

In addition to analytical equations, as the project progresses we expect to support the following machine learning models:

* Neural networks (feedforward, convolutional, recurrent) via Caffe or Keras
* Scikit-learn models (tree ensembles, support vector machines, generalized linear models, feature engineering, pipeline models)

## Submitting a code contribution

We only have a few guidelines at present:

* Please be [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant (not strict about line length, but try to keep docstrings to 72 characters, code to 100)
* We're targeting Python 3.6+ only
* We're hoping to add [type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) for the core code
* If a function or method returns multiple values, return a `namedtuple`, this allows easier refactoring later and more readable code. Functions and methods should also always consistently return the same types (with the exception of `None`).
* If you spot a bad practice / anti-pattern in the code, you're honor bound to report it :-)

# Web Interface

Each model and property will have an auto-generated page associated with them. This page will allow manual input of model parameters and calculation of model outputs, and will also provide documentation/explanations of how each model works. The uses the [Dash library by plot.ly](https://plot.ly/products/dash/). To test it out, you can run the `app.py`, or can see the app deployed online at [https://propnet.herokuapp.com](https://propnet.herokuapp.com).
